# Simple-Linear-Regression-Model
This is a statistics project based on linear regression. My start to machine learning. I had to take some help while building this.
It basically takes the nav values for SBI energy opportunities fund for a month and calculates the mean median mode and standard deviation of it. It fits a curve to the different values of the nav and provides a plot.
It also evaluates the 95% confidence interval for the average nav value provided the population sd is 2.3.
